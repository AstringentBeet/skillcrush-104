			<h2>I originally hated software development</h2>

			<p>I was drawn to it out of interest for having the potential of being a creative outlet as well as the salary, but found the initial dive to be an overwhelming mess. There were times when I decided to give up out of discouragement, but I somehow found myself back on my laptop typing away questions on the internet. A year later, I find that I still know nothing in the sense that I have only a basic understanding of how developers operate, but it's an enjoying experience to be apart of something bigger.</p>
		
			<h3>Embrace confusion!</h3>

			<p>As you begin programming your first web app, you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h3>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h3>
			
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>

			<h3>The master has failed more time than the beginner ever tried</h3>

			<p>I stand against the notion that one can truly master a field, rather they gain greter proficiency in molding their skill as long as they are granted the opportunity of time.</p>
			
			<p>I state not out of pseudo-philisophical spite, but how it stands by the world of software development (or any field for that matter). Nobody knows what their doing when they first explore a field unfamiliar to them; It's quite a daunting task to do so, but the rewards that are to be sowed from facing trials of the unknown are beyond satisfying.</p>

			<p>So don't be afraid of error, as you'll be facing that a plentiful amount of times before you get ahead, and that's the beauty of it!</p>
